The report data is provided below:

# Tag Descriptions
"Wants", "Musts", "Debt & Savings" and "No Tag" are the four tags that the user has used to categorize their transactions.
"Wants" are optional discretionary spending, "Musts" are mandatory expenses, "Debt & Savings" are payments towards debt or savings,
and "No Tag" are transactions that the user has not categorized.

# Tag Summary
The following data inside triple backticks is a summary of the user's spending using the tags above:

Given the report data above, you should provide a helpful response to the user advising them

Special attention should be given to the ratio of "Musts" to "Wants" to "Debt & Savings".
One goal is to make that ratio 50/30/20: fee free to share that as part of your advice.
